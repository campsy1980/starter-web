Sadio Mane admits he is not yet at full fitness but the Liverpool forward is already confident of improving on an excellent debut season with the club.

On Saturday the Senegal international made his first appearance for the Reds since April 1, when a knee injury sustained against Everton at Anfield ended his campaign prematurely.

Maneâ€™s 45-minute outing in the 3-0 friendly victory over Hertha BSC at the weekend was a satisfying step on the road to complete rehabilitation for the No.19.
